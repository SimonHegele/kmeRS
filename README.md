# kmeRS

My first Rust project, a simple tool to count kmers in nucleotide sequences from FASTA/FASTQ files.<br>

The Implementation in kmeRS is pretty straight forward and not optimized.<br>
Check out Jellyfish if you need actual speed (https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish)

## Usage

`cargo run <infile> <k> <threads>`
